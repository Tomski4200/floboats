# Session Note A011 - Dashboard Improvements and Bug Fixes

**Date:** 2025-01-03  
**Developer:** Claude (Opus 4)  
**Session Duration:** ~30 minutes  

## Summary
Fixed dashboard bugs related to liked events display and profile completion tracking. Added navigation improvements to the user profile page. These were follow-up fixes to the event likes and attendance implementation from session A010.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Liked Events Display on Dashboard
- **Issue**: Liked events were being counted but not displayed in the dashboard's "Liked Events" section
- **Root Cause**: Supabase query was attempting to filter by nested field `event.event_start` which isn't supported
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed the nested field filter from the Supabase query
  - Fetched all liked events for the user
  - Implemented client-side filtering in JavaScript to:
    - Filter for upcoming events only
    - Sort by event start date
    - Limit to 3 most recent upcoming events
- **Result**: Liked events now properly display on the dashboard

### 2. Fixed Profile Status Tracking
- **Issue**: Profile completion status wasn't updating when users added their name and profile photo
- **Root Cause**: Code was checking for non-existent `profile.name` field instead of the actual database columns
- **Solution**:
  - Updated to check `profile.first_name` AND `profile.last_name` for name completion
  - Added check for `profile.avatar_url` for profile photo status
  - Added check for `profile.bio` for bio completion
- **Result**: Profile status now accurately reflects completion state with proper checkmarks

### 3. Added Dashboard Navigation to Profile Page
- **Enhancement**: Added "View Dashboard" button to the Quick Actions section on user profile page
- **Implementation**:
  - Added new button above "Manage My Boats"
  - Used gray color scheme (bg-gray-600) to differentiate from other actions
  - Added home icon for visual clarity
  - Maintains consistent styling with other Quick Action buttons
- **Result**: Users can now easily navigate from their profile to their dashboard

## Technical Details

### Dashboard Query Fix
```javascript
// Before (not working):
.gte('event.event_start', new Date().toISOString())

// After (working):
// Fetch all, then filter client-side
const now = new Date().toISOString()
upcomingLikedEvents = likedEvents
  .filter(item => item.event !== null && item.event.event_start >= now)
  .sort((a, b) => new Date(a.event.event_start).getTime() - new Date(b.event.event_start).getTime())
  .slice(0, 3)
```

### Profile Status Checks
```javascript
// Before:
profile?.name

// After:
(profile?.first_name && profile?.last_name)  // For name
profile?.avatar_url                           // For photo
profile?.bio                                  // For bio
```

## Files Modified

### Modified Files
- `/nextjs/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Fixed liked events query and profile status checks
- `/nextjs/app/profile/page.tsx` - Added View Dashboard button to Quick Actions

## Current Status
✅ All dashboard display issues resolved
✅ Profile completion tracking working correctly
✅ Navigation improvements implemented

## Testing Notes
- Verified liked events appear immediately after liking
- Confirmed profile status updates reflect actual data
- Tested dashboard navigation from profile page

## Follow-up Considerations
- Consider caching liked events data for better performance
- Add loading states for dashboard sections that fetch data
- Consider adding more quick actions based on user role (e.g., event organizer actions)
