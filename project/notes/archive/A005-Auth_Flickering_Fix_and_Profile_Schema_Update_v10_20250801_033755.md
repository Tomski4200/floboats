# A005 - Auth Flickering Fix and Profile Schema Update

**Date:** 2025-07-01  
**Duration:** ~30 minutes  
**Status:** Completed - Auth flickering resolved, profile schema updated

## Session Summary

Fixed authentication state flickering on dashboard by adding loading states to prevent UI from showing incorrect auth status during initial load. Also resolved profile creation error by adding email column to the profiles table.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Added Email Column to Profiles Table
- **Issue:** Profile creation was failing with "Could not find the 'email' column" error
- **Solution:** User ran SQL to add email column with UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints
- **Result:** Profile creation now works properly on first login

### 2. Fixed Auth State Flickering
- **Issue:** Dashboard would flicker between "Not signed in" and user email multiple times
- **Root Cause:** UI was rendering before auth state was loaded from Supabase
- **Solution:** 
  - Added loading placeholders in Header component
  - Desktop auth buttons show skeleton loader during auth check
  - Mobile menu shows loading state as well
  - Prevents UI from showing incorrect state

### 3. Cleaned Up Debug Logging
- **Removed:** Console.log statements from Header and AuthProvider
- **Result:** Cleaner console output in production

## Technical Implementation

### Loading State UI
```tsx
// Desktop auth section
{loading ? (
  <div className="animate-pulse flex space-x-4">
    <div className="rounded-md bg-gray-200 h-10 w-20"></div>
    <div className="rounded-md bg-gray-200 h-10 w-20"></div>
  </div>
) : user ? (
  // Show user menu
) : (
  // Show sign in/up buttons
)}
```

### Profile Schema Update
```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD COLUMN email TEXT UNIQUE;

UPDATE profiles 
SET email = auth.users.email 
FROM auth.users 
WHERE profiles.id = auth.users.id;

ALTER TABLE profiles 
ALTER COLUMN email SET NOT NULL;
```

## Current Auth Flow

1. User visits site - sees loading placeholders
2. AuthProvider checks session with Supabase
3. Once loaded, UI updates to show correct auth state
4. No more flickering between states
5. Profile creation includes email field

## Files Modified

1. `/nextjs/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Added loading states
2. `/nextjs/lib/auth-context.tsx` - Removed debug logs
3. `/nextjs/app/auth/callback/route.ts` - Re-added email field to profile creation
4. Database: `profiles` table - Added email column

## Next Steps

With authentication working smoothly, the next priorities from the sprint are:

1. **Create User Profile Pages**
   - Profile viewing page
   - Profile editing with avatar upload
   - Public profile URLs

2. **Build Boat Management**
   - CRUD operations for boats
   - Photo upload system
   - Boat specifications editor

3. **Marketplace Features**
   - Create/edit listings
   - Browse with filters
   - Search functionality

## Session Notes

The auth flickering issue is now resolved. Users will see smooth loading states instead of the UI jumping between logged in/out states. The profile creation also works properly with the email field included. 

The fix was implemented using loading placeholders rather than trying to pass server-side auth state, keeping the solution simple and maintainable.
