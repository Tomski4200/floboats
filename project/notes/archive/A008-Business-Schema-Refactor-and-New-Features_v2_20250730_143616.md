# Session Note A008 - Business Schema Refactor and New Features

**Date:** 2025-07-02
**Developer:** Cline
**Session Duration:** ~2 hours

## Summary
This session focused on a major refactoring of the business directory schema to support more complex relationships, and the implementation of several new features and bug fixes based on user feedback.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Business Schema Refactoring
- **Multi-Category Support:** Implemented a many-to-many relationship between businesses and categories by creating a `business_to_category_links` join table.
- **Business Groups:** Introduced a `business_groups` table to allow for the grouping of multiple businesses under a single parent entity.
- **Permissions Model:** Created a `user_business_permissions` table to manage user roles (owner, manager) for both individual businesses and business groups.

### 2. New Features
- **Radius-Based Search:**
    - Added a `distance` function to the database to calculate the distance between two points.
    - Created a `nearby_businesses` RPC function to find businesses within a specified radius.
    - Implemented a geocoding API route to convert location strings to coordinates.
    - Updated the business filters UI to include inputs for location and radius.
- **Business Owner CTA:**
    - Created a dismissible "For Business Owners" call-to-action component.
    - Added the CTA to the main business directory and homepage.
- **Claim Business Page:** Created a new page for business owners to search for and begin the process of claiming their business listing.
- **Footer Links:** Added "Claim Your Business" and "Create a Listing" links to the site footer.

### 3. Bug Fixes & Improvements
- **Component Import Errors:** Resolved a persistent issue with component imports by correcting casing inconsistencies and ensuring all necessary dependencies were installed.
- **Authentication Loop:** Fixed a redirect loop and flickering authentication state by implementing a `ProtectedPage` component and removing conflicting redirect logic from the auth context.
- **UI Polish:**
    - Corrected the background color of dropdown menus to ensure readability.
    - Updated the "Create New Business" form to remove the group selection, simplifying the user experience.
    - Refined the list of business categories to be more specific and relevant.

## Database Changes

### Tables Created
1.  `business_groups`
2.  `user_business_permissions`
3.  `business_to_category_links`

### Functions Created
1.  `distance(lat, long, lat, long)`
2.  `nearby_businesses(lat, long, radius)`

### RLS Policies Created
- New policies were created for `business_groups`, `user_business_permissions`, and `business_to_category_links` to enforce the new permissions model.

- `/nextjs/app/businesses/claim/page.tsx`

## Handoff Notes
The core infrastructure for business groups, multi-category support, and radius search is now in place. The next steps will be to build out the UI for managing group members and permissions, and to fully integrate the radius search into the user-facing filters.
