# Session Note A002 - Roadmap Creation and Documentation System Setup
*Date: 2025-06-30*  
*Developer/Agent: Claude*  
*Session Duration: ~1 hour*

## Session Summary
Established a comprehensive development tracking system using a hybrid approach combining high-level roadmaps, sprint tracking, detailed documentation, and inline TODO comments. Reorganized project files into logical folder structure.

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Reviewed all project documentation (.md and .sql files)
- ✅ Created ROADMAP.md with 5-phase development overview
- ✅ Created CURRENT_SPRINT.md for Week 1 task tracking
- ✅ Established documentation system in /documentation folder
- ✅ Created documentation README.md with standards and guidelines
- ✅ Created documentation INDEX.md for navigation
- ✅ Created sample documentation (folder-structure.md)
- ✅ Reorganized files into /project subfolder
- ✅ Implemented session notes system with INDEX.md
- ✅ Created START_HERE.md in root as entry point to memory system

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Hybrid Tracking Approach**: Combining ROADMAP.md (high-level), CURRENT_SPRINT.md (active work), documentation folder (technical docs), and inline TODO comments
2. **Documentation Structure**: Separate folders for features, API, database, components, integrations, deployment, and architecture
3. **Timestamp System**: All docs include creation date, last update, and status (Draft/Active/Needs Review/Deprecated)
4. **TODO Comment Format**: Structured format with categories like TODO[HIGH], TODO[auth], FIXME, HACK, NOTE
5. **Project Organization**: /project folder for planning docs, /documentation for technical docs
6. **Notes System**: Sequential numbering (A001-A999) with INDEX.md at parent level for easy discovery

## Next Session Focus
According to CURRENT_SPRINT.md, the immediate priorities are:
1. Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript and App Router
2. Deploy database schema (floboats_schema.sql) to Supabase
3. Create Supabase client configuration
4. Set up basic layout structure (header, footer, navigation)

## Important Notes/Blockers
- **Database Password**: Still needed for direct connection strings in .env
- **Mapbox API Key**: Required for location-based features
- **Image Service**: Need to decide on CDN/optimization service
- **Component Library**: Decision needed - custom build or use Radix UI?

## Code References
### Created Files
- `/project/ROADMAP.md` - High-level project roadmap
- `/project/CURRENT_SPRINT.md` - Week 1 sprint details
- `/documentation/README.md` - Documentation system guide
- `/documentation/INDEX.md` - Documentation navigation
- `/documentation/architecture/folder-structure.md` - Example doc
- `/project/notes/INDEX.md` - Notes navigation system
- `/project/notes/notes/A002-*.md` - This session note
- `/START_HERE.md` - Root entry point to memory system

### Moved Files
- All `.md` files moved from root to `/project/`
- `floboats_schema.sql` moved to `/project/`
- Note A001 moved to `/project/notes/notes/`

## Session Handoff
The project is now well-organized with clear tracking systems in place. The next developer/agent should:
1. Read CURRENT_SPRINT.md for immediate tasks
2. Reference ROADMAP.md for phase context
3. Use documentation/INDEX.md to find technical docs
4. Continue updating tracking files as work progresses

Ready to begin actual development in Phase 1!
