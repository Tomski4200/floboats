## Technical Verifications

### Database Connection

- Sample data returned: "Marinas, Boat Dealerships, Boat Repair & Service"

### Authentication Flow
- Google OAuth properly configured
- Callback URL set to `/auth/callback`
- Profile creation on first login implemented

## Current Status

### Working Features
- ✅ Google OAuth authentication
- ✅ User profile creation on signup
- ✅ Database queries on homepage
- ✅ Mobile-responsive navigation with auth
- ✅ Loading states for better UX
- ✅ Logout functionality across all views

### Environment
- Next.js dev server running on port 3000
- WSL environment (avoiding Windows compatibility issues)
- All environment variables properly configured
- Supabase connection established

## Next Steps

Based on the current sprint goals, the next priorities are:

1. **Create User Profile Pages**
   - Profile viewing page
   - Profile editing functionality
   - Avatar upload system

2. **Implement Protected Routes**
   - Ensure dashboard is properly protected
   - Add middleware for route protection
   - Handle unauthorized access gracefully

3. **Basic Boat Management**
   - Create boat listing pages
   - Implement CRUD operations
   - Add photo upload for boats

4. **Seed Initial Data**
   - Add sample boats to database
   - Create demo user accounts
   - Populate business directory

## Session Notes

Authentication system is now fully functional. The auth callback route handles OAuth flow properly and creates user profiles automatically. The mobile menu has been enhanced with user-specific options and logout functionality. Loading states provide better visual feedback during auth operations.

The server is stable and running well. Database connections are working as expected. Ready to move forward with building out user features and boat management functionality.
