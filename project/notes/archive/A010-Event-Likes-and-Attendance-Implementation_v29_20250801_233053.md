# Session Note A010 - Event Likes and Attendance Implementation

**Date:** 2025-01-03  
**Developer:** Claude (Opus 4)  
**Session Duration:** ~2 hours  

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive event engagement features including likes, attendance tracking with calendar integration, and analytics dashboards for event organizers. Created database schema, updated UI components, and added new dashboard pages for managing event engagement.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Database Schema Implementation
- **Created new tables**:
  - `event_likes` - Tracks which users have liked events
  - `event_attendees` - Manages RSVPs with status tracking (going/interested/not_going)
- **Added database functions**:
  - `get_event_like_count()` - Returns like count for an event
  - `get_event_attendee_count()` - Returns attendee count by status
- **Created views with profile data**:
  - `event_likes_with_profile` - Joins likes with user profiles
  - `event_attendees_with_profile` - Joins attendees with user profiles
- **Implemented RLS policies** for secure data access
- **Added trigger** to automatically update attendee_count on events table

### 2. Event Details Page Enhancements
- **Like functionality**:
  - Heart button now fully functional
  - Shows filled heart when liked
  - Toast notifications for user feedback
  - Requires authentication
- **Attendance tracking**:
  - "Attend Event" button with status toggle
  - Automatic calendar file (.ics) generation and download
  - Updates attendee count in real-time
  - Shows "Event Full" when max capacity reached

### 3. User Dashboard Improvements
- **Liked Events section** on main dashboard:
  - Shows count of liked events
  - Displays next 3 upcoming liked events
  - Quick link to view all liked events
- **Dedicated Liked Events page** (`/dashboard/liked-events`):
  - Separated into Upcoming and Past events
  - Card-based layout with event details
  - Visual indicators for liked status

### 4. Event Organizer Features
- **Enhanced Events Dashboard** (`/dashboard/events`):
  - Added "Total Likes" stat card
  - Shows like count on each event card
  - 5-column stat layout for better metrics visibility
- **Attendee Management Page** (`/dashboard/events/[id]/attendees`):
  - View attendees by status (Going/Interested/Not Going)
  - See all users who liked the event
  - Export attendee list as CSV
  - Shows attendee avatars and RSVP dates
  - Search functionality for finding specific attendees

### 5. Technical Implementation Details
- **Calendar Integration**:
  - Generates standard .ics files
  - Includes event title, description, location, and timing
  - Handles all-day events properly
  - Compatible with all major calendar applications
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Added database indexes on foreign keys
  - Batch queries for like counts in dashboard
  - Efficient view joins for profile data

## Migration Iterations
Had to create multiple versions of the SQL migration due to schema discovery:
- v1: Initial attempt (failed due to missing context)
- v2: Added DROP statements for clean migration
- v3: Fixed profiles table join (id vs user_id)
- v4: Fixed column names (first_name/last_name instead of full_name)

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `/supabase/migrations/20250103_event_likes_and_attendance_v4.sql` - Final working migration
- `/nextjs/app/dashboard/liked-events/page.tsx` - Liked events listing page
- `/nextjs/app/dashboard/events/[id]/attendees/page.tsx` - Attendee management page

### Modified Files
- `/nextjs/app/events/[id]/page.tsx` - Added calendar generation and fixed like/attend handlers
- `/nextjs/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added liked events section
- `/nextjs/app/dashboard/events/page.tsx` - Added like counts and stats

## Current Status
✅ All features implemented and tested
✅ Database migration successfully applied
✅ UI components fully functional
✅ Calendar integration working
✅ CSV export operational

## Next Steps
- Consider adding email notifications for event reminders
- Implement social sharing of liked events
- Add attendee messaging features
- Create event check-in functionality for organizers
- Consider privacy settings for attendee lists

## Notes for Next Developer
- Email addresses are stored in profiles table but not exposed in views for privacy
- The attendee_count on events table only counts "going" status, not "interested"
- Calendar files use the event slug in the URL for better sharing
- The liked events use slugs when available, falling back to IDs for older events
