# Session Notes - January 3, 2025
## Slug Implementation for Events and Venues

### Summary
In this session, we implemented SEO-friendly slug-based URLs for both events and venues, replacing the UUID-based URLs with human-readable slugs.

### Key Accomplishments

#### 1. Fixed Venue Detail Page UI Issues
- Fixed icon alignment issues on "Open in Google Maps" and "Get Directions" buttons
- Removed left/right margins from embedded Google Maps iframe
- Used proper flexbox alignment with `inline-flex items-center`

#### 2. Implemented Event Slugs
Created a comprehensive slug system for events with format:
- **Pattern**: `[first-4-words]-[city]-[state]-[month]-[year]`
- **Example**: `/events/independence-day-boat-parade-sarasota-fl-july-2025`

Features implemented:
- Database migration to add `slug` column to events table
- Automatic slug generation function
- Trigger for new events
- Backward compatibility with UUID-based URLs

#### 3. Implemented Venue Slugs
Created slug system for venues with format:
- **Pattern**: `[venue-name]-[city]-[state]`
- **Example**: `/venues/miami-beach-convention-center-miami-beach-fl`

Features implemented:
- Database migration to add `slug` column to event_venues table
- Automatic slug generation function
- Trigger for new venues
- Backward compatibility with UUID-based URLs

#### 4. Fixed Slug Generation Bug
Discovered and fixed a regex issue that was removing first letters of words:
- **Bug**: "Biscayne Bay" became "iscayneay"
- **Fix**: Changed order of operations to replace special characters before lowercasing

#### 5. Created Comprehensive Migration
Merged all slug-related migrations into a single safe migration file:
- `/supabase/migrations/20250103_add_all_slugs_safe.sql`
- Handles existing triggers/functions gracefully
- Fixes any broken slugs from previous attempts
- Populates all existing records with proper slugs

### Technical Details

#### Files Modified
1. `/app/events/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated to handle slug or ID
2. `/app/venues/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated to handle slug or ID
3. `/app/events/page.tsx` - Updated links to use slugs
4. `/app/dashboard/events/page.tsx` - Updated links to use slugs
5. All TypeScript interfaces updated to include optional slug field

#### Database Changes
- Added `slug` column to `events` table (UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
- Added `slug` column to `event_venues` table (UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
- Created indexes on slug columns for performance
- Added automatic slug generation triggers

#### Migration Results
- 10 events successfully assigned slugs
- 15 venues successfully assigned slugs
- 0 empty slugs - 100% coverage

### Next Steps
- Monitor slug generation for new events/venues
- Consider adding slug editing capability in admin interface
- Potentially implement redirects from old URLs to new slug URLs
- Update sitemap generation to use slug URLs

### Notes
- The system maintains backward compatibility - old UUID URLs still work
- Slugs are automatically generated and ensure uniqueness
- If duplicate slugs are detected, a counter is appended (e.g., `venue-name-2`)
- Google Maps API key was integrated into venue detail pages
