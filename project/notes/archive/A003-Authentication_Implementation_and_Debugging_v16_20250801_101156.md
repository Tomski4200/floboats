# A003 - Authentication Implementation and Debugging

**Date:** 2025-07-01  
**Duration:** ~2.5 hours  
**Status:** In Progress - Auth system implemented but needs server restart to apply fixes

## Session Summary

Continued from previous session where database schema was deployed. Implemented full authentication system with Google OAuth and debugged Next.js 15 compatibility issues.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Critical Next.js 15 Error
- **Issue:** `cookies()` function needs to be awaited in Next.js 15
- **Solution:** Made `createServerSupabaseClient` async and added await to cookies() call
- **File:** `/nextjs/lib/supabase-server.ts`

### 2. Enhanced Authentication UI
- Added yellow debug box to Header showing auth state
- Improved user dropdown menu with better visibility
- Added comprehensive auth debugging pages

### 3. Created Authentication Test Pages
- `/test-auth` - Comprehensive auth testing with client/server state comparison
- `/auth-debug` - Simple auth state viewer
- `/api/debug-auth` - Cookie inspection endpoint
- `/api/test-env` - Environment variable checker

### 4. Fixed Server-Side Rendering Issues
- Updated all pages using `createServerSupabaseClient` to await the async function
- Fixed homepage and dashboard TypeScript errors
- Added proper error handling

## Technical Issues Encountered

### 1. Windows Development Environment
- SWC binary errors when running on Windows directly
- Solution: Switched to WSL for development
- Removed `--turbopack` flag from dev script

### 2. Next.js File Caching
- Changes not being reflected due to aggressive caching
- Server showing old versions of files despite edits
- Requires server restart to pick up changes

### 3. Google Fonts Timeout
- Consistent timeouts fetching Geist fonts
- Non-critical - falls back to system fonts

## Current Authentication Status
- Google OAuth provider configured and working
- User can sign in but UI state not updating properly
- Auth cookies being set correctly
- Protected routes (dashboard) working but need fixes applied

## Files Modified

1. `/nextjs/lib/supabase-server.ts` - Made async, fixed cookies() await
2. `/nextjs/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Added debug UI, improved dropdown
3. `/nextjs/app/page.tsx` - Simplified to remove database query temporarily
4. `/nextjs/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added await and error handling
5. `/nextjs/app/layout.tsx` - Fixed viewport metadata warning
6. `/nextjs/package.json` - Removed --turbopack flag
7. Multiple test pages created for debugging

## Next Steps (To Do)

1. **Restart server** to apply all fixes
2. Verify authentication flow works end-to-end
3. Re-enable database queries on homepage
4. Test user profile creation on first login
5. Implement logout functionality in mobile menu
6. Add loading states for auth operations
7. Complete remaining protected routes

## Environment Notes
- Running on WSL (Ubuntu) to avoid Windows compatibility issues
- Next.js 15.3.4 with React 19
- Supabase SSR package for authentication
- Development server on http://localhost:3000

## Session Wrap-up
Authentication system is implemented but requires server restart to apply fixes. The main blocking issue was Next.js 15's requirement to await cookies() which has been resolved. User successfully authenticated with Google OAuth but UI state updates need the fixed code to be loaded.

*Note: Server needs restart with `npm run dev` in WSL to apply all fixes made during this session.*
