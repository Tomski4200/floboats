# Session Note A012 - Forums Implementation

**Date:** 2025-07-03
**Developer:** Cline
**Session Duration:** ~1 hour

## Summary
This session was dedicated to reviewing and documenting the implementation of the new forums section of the site. The forums are a major new feature that will allow users to engage with each other, ask questions, and build a community.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Comprehensive Database Schema
- **Tables:** A complete set of tables was created to support the forums, including `forum_categories`, `forum_tags`, `forum_threads`, `forum_replies`, `forum_thread_tags`, `forum_thread_likes`, and `forum_reply_likes`.
- **Relationships:** The schema includes support for nested replies, many-to-many relationships between threads and tags, and a robust system for tracking likes on both threads and replies.
- **Reputation System:** A `reputation_score` is calculated for each user based on their activity in the forums, including creating threads and replies, and receiving likes.

### 2. Feature-Rich User Interface
- **Forum Homepage:** A well-designed homepage displays a grid of forum categories, a feed of recent activity, and a list of top contributors.
- **Category Pages:** Each category has its own page that lists all the threads within that category, with options for sorting and filtering.
- **Thread Pages:** The thread pages are the heart of the forums, with support for nested replies, likes, and user badges that display reputation scores.
- **Thread Creation:** A dedicated page allows users to create new threads, with a rich text editor, category and tag selectors, and a preview mode.

### 3. Robust Backend
- **RLS Policies:** A comprehensive set of Row-Level Security policies has been implemented to ensure that users can only perform actions that they are authorized to do.
- **Database Functions and Triggers:** A suite of database functions and triggers has been created to automatically calculate reputation scores, update view and reply counts, and generate SEO-friendly slugs for threads.
- **API Routes:** A set of API routes has been created to support all the functionality of the forums, including fetching data, creating new content, and managing likes.
