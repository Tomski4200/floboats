## Claude Code Specific Instructions

### Development Approach
```markdown
Claude Code should:
1. Build complete, functional features before moving to the next
2. Include comprehensive error handling and loading states
3. Write clean, maintainable code with proper TypeScript types
4. Implement proper security practices (input validation, XSS prevention)
5. Include basic styling with Tailwind classes for structure
6. Add detailed comments for complex business logic
7. Create database seeds with realistic test data
8. Build API endpoints with proper validation and error responses
```

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Authentication:** Use Supabase Auth with email + Google/Facebook
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Row Level Security enabled
- **State Management:** React Query for server state, Zustand for client state
- **Forms:** React Hook Form with Zod validation schemas
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Maps:** Mapbox GL JS for location features
- **Images:** Supabase Storage with automatic optimization

### Code Quality Standards
```javascript
// Example of expected code quality:
export async function createBoatListing(data: CreateListingData) {
  try {
    // Validate input data
    const validatedData = createListingSchema.parse(data);
    
    // Check user permissions
    const { data: user, error: authError } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
    if (authError || !user) throw new Error('Unauthorized');
    
    // Create listing with proper error handling
    const { data: listing, error } = await supabase
      .from('listings')
      .insert(validatedData)
      .select()
      .single();
      
    if (error) throw error;
    
    // Update related data (boat status, user stats, etc.)
    await updateBoatListingStatus(listing.boat_id, true);
    
    return { success: true, data: listing };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to create listing:', error);
    return { success: false, error: error.message };
  }
}
```
